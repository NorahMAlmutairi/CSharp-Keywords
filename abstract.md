# abstract

## Concept 
The `abstract` modifier indicates that the thing being modified has a missing or incomplete implementation. The abstract modifier can be used with classes, methods, properties, indexers, and events. Use the `abstract` modifier in a class declaration to indicate that a class is intended only to be a base class of other classes, not instantiated on its own. Members marked as abstract must be implemented by non-abstract classes that derive from the abstract class.

## Example 
In this example, the class `Square` must provide an implementation of `GetArea` because it derives from `Shape`:

```C#
abstract class Shape
{
    public abstract int GetArea();
}

class Square : Shape
{
    int side;

    public Square(int n) => side = n;

    // GetArea method is required to avoid a compile-time error.
    public override int GetArea() => side * side;

    static void Main()
    {
        var sq = new Square(12);
        Console.WriteLine($"Area of the square = {sq.GetArea()}");
    }
}
// Output: Area of the square = 144
```
