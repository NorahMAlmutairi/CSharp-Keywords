# base

## Concept 
The `base` keyword is used to access members of the base class from within a derived class:

- Call a method on the base class that has been overridden by another method.
- Specify which base-class constructor should be called when creating instances of the derived class.

A base class access is permitted only in a constructor, an instance method, or an instance property accessor.

It is an error to use the `base` keyword from within a static method.

The base class that is accessed is the base class specified in the class declaration. For example, if you specify `class ClassB : ClassA`, the members of ClassA are accessed from ClassB, regardless of the base class of ClassA.

## Example 
In this example, both the base class, `Person`, and the derived class, `Employee`, have a method named `Getinfo`. By using the `base` keyword, it is possible to call the `Getinfo` method on the base class, from within the derived class.

```C#
public class Person
{
    protected string ssn = "444-55-6666";
    protected string name = "John L. Malgraine";

    public virtual void GetInfo()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Name: {0}", name);
        Console.WriteLine("SSN: {0}", ssn);
    }
}
class Employee : Person
{
    public string id = "ABC567EFG";
    public override void GetInfo()
    {
        // Calling the base class GetInfo method:
        base.GetInfo();
        Console.WriteLine("Employee ID: {0}", id);
    }
}

class TestClass
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Employee E = new Employee();
        E.GetInfo();
    }
}
/*
Output
Name: John L. Malgraine
SSN: 444-55-6666
Employee ID: ABC567EFG
*/
```
