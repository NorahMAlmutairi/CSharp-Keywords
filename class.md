# class

## Concept 
A class is like a blueprint of a specific object. In the real world, every object has some color, shape, and functionalities. Only single inheritance is allowed in C#. In other words, a class can inherit implementation from one base class only. However, a class can implement more than one interface.

## Example 
Classes are declared using the keyword `class`, as shown in the following example:

```C#
class TestClass
{
    // Methods, properties, fields, events, delegates
    // and nested classes go here.
}
```
